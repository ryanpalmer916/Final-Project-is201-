                        <p>
                            I'm Ryan Palmer, a finance student at Brigham Young University with a passion for real estate, financial analysis, and emerging technologies. My journey in finance began during high school when I started exploring investment strategies and became fascinated by the real estate market. This early interest led me to pursue a business education at BYU, where I've maintained a 3.88 GPA while actively participating in case competitions and finance-related extracurricular activities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My professional experience includes internships with Dental Property Group and AgReserves, where I've developed practical skills in financial modeling, real estate analysis, and business operations. These experiences have reinforced my interest in commercial real estate and investment analysis, while also exposing me to the importance of technology in modern business practices. I'm particularly drawn to the intersection of finance and technology, exploring how AI and automation can revolutionize traditional financial processes and decision-making.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I'm an advocate for continuous learning and personal development. I believe in the power of combining analytical thinking with creative problem-solving, which has served me well in both my studies and internships. As I continue my education, I aim to further develop my expertise in finance while embracing innovative approaches to business challenges.
